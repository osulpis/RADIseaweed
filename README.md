# RADIseaweed

Model simulations corresponding to the manuscript "Fate of ocean forestation organic carbon at the deep seafloor", submitted to Nature Sustainability, and authored by Merel Lanjouw, Jack Middelburg and Olivier Sulpis. 

After the first round of peer review, the code will be deposited on a permanent repository, such as zenodo, with an associated doi referred to in the manuscript. 

The main model code is with the file "RADI1_seaweed.m". Before running the model, initial conditions need to be loaded, by running one of the files starting by "IC".
